	abstract = {Accurate mapping and timely monitoring of urban redevelopment are pivotal for urban studies and decision-makers to foster sustainable urban development. Traditional mapping methods heavily depend on field surveys and subjective questionnaires, yielding less objective, reliable, and timely data. Recent advancements in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and remote-sensing technologies have improved the identification and mapping of urban redevelopment through quantitative analysis using satellite-based observations. Nonetheless, challenges persist, particularly concerning accuracy and significant temporal delays. This study introduces a novel approach to modeling urban redevelopment, leveraging machine learning algorithms and remote-sensing data. This methodology can facilitate the accurate and timely identification of urban redevelopment activities. The study's machine learning model can analyze time-series remote-sensing data to identify spatio-temporal and spectral patterns related to urban redevelopment. The model is thoroughly evaluated, and the results indicate that it can accurately capture the time-series patterns of urban redevelopment. This research's findings are useful for evaluating urban demographic and economic changes, informing policymaking and urban planning, and contributing to sustainable urban development. The model can also serve as a foundation for future research on early-stage urban redevelopment detection and evaluation of the causes and impacts of urban redevelopment. © 2024},

	abstract = {Humans have entered the era of big data. Research ideas and methods based on big data have gained much attention and start to apply widely in the field of geoscience. In our view, the subject of big data research is data, the tool is the computer, the method and means are to find out the correlation between data, and the characteristics is to make decisions based on probability criteria. To reiterate: big data is the idea and method of finding out the correlation between data; it researches problems and make correct decisions by mining large amounts of data. In this paper, we suggest that the inductive method is the way to carry out big data research, specially as its research power has been greatly enhanced by high performance computer and big data technology. Through an in-depth analyses of statistics and machine learning algorithm, we came to the conclusion that big data shall change the ways people learn and understand nature and scientific studies are designed and performed. And it shall subvert the long-standing habit of conducting scientific research by finding causal relationships. Big data shall create a new approach to conducting geoscience research across complex causal relationships and obtaining research results directly. We concluded in this study that with the explosive growth of data, and with popularization of high-performance computers and rapid development of computing technology, the statistical analysis method has largely broken through the limitation of data volume. This shall enable statistical analysis and prediction models to generate truer thus more reliable results. Ultimately, the ability to explain conditions and outcomes, combining with the advantages of machine learning algorithms for semi-structured and unstructured data, will make quantitative geoscience research truly feasible.},

	doi = {10.1109/ICMLA58977.2023.00101},
	abstract = {The warming of the Arctic, also known as Arctic amplification, is led by several atmospheric and oceanic drivers. However, the details of its underlying thermodynamic causes are still unknown. Inferring the causal effects of atmospheric processes on sea ice melt using fixed treatment effect strategies leads to unrealistic counterfactual estimations. Such methods are also prone to bias due to time-varying confoundedness. Further, the complex non-linearity in Earth science data makes it infeasible to perform causal inference using existing marginal structural techniques. In order to tackle these challenges, we propose TCINet - Time-series Causal Inference Network to infer causation under continuous treatment using recurrent neural networks and a novel probabilistic balancing technique. More specifically, we propose a neural network based potential outcome model using the long-short-term-memory (LSTM) layers for time-delayed factual and counterfactual predictions with a custom weighted loss. To tackle the confounding bias, we experiment with multiple balancing strategies, namely TCINet with the inverse probability weighting (IPTW), TCINet with stabilized weights using Gaussian Mixture Model (GMMs) and TCINet without any balancing technique. Through experiments on synthetic and observational data, we show how our research can substantially improve the ability to quantify leading causes of Arctic sea ice melt, further paving paths for causal inference in observational Earth science.},

	abstract = {In recent years, there has been a prominent focus on enhancing the quality of features derived from convolutional neural networks (CNNs) within the field of polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) image classification. Targeting this challenge, this article first visualizes the lack of discriminability and generalizability in CNN features through several empirical observations. Subsequently, we explain why these problems arise from a causal perspective, accomplished by means of a structural causal model (SCM) constructed according to the training and testing process of CNNs. This SCM facilitates the identification of variables that affect the quality of PolSAR image feature learning, as well as an intervention on those variables using backdoor adjustment. Building upon this groundwork, a novel causal inference-guided feature enhancement framework is constructed. It can be seamlessly integrated into any CNN-based PolSAR image classifier in a plug-and-play manner, enabling the enhanced classifier to filter out interference information and prevent model overfitting. These two aspects bring better feature discriminability and generalizability, respectively, leading to improved classification performance. Experimental results on four widely-used PolSAR image datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework. We integrate it into several mainstream methods in the field and show that the accuracy of the enhanced classifier is improved compared to the original model.},

	abstract = {Uncovering the causal relations that exist among variables in multivariate datasets is one of the ultimate goals in data analytics. Causation is related to correlation but correlation does not imply causation. While a number of casual discovery algorithms have been devised that eliminate spurious correlations from a network, there are no guarantees that all of the inferred causations are indeed true. Hence, bringing a domain expert into the casual reasoning loop can be of great benefit in identifying erroneous casual relationships suggested by the discovery algorithm. To address this need we present the Visual Causal Analyst - a novel visual causal reasoning framework that allows users to apply their expertise, verify and edit causal links, and collaborate with the causal discovery algorithm to identify a valid causal network. Its interface consists of both an interactive 2D graph view and a numerical presentation of salient statistical parameters, such as regression coefficients, p-values, and others. Both help users in gaining a good understanding of the landscape of causal structures particularly when the number of variables is large. Our framework is also novel in that it can handle both numerical and categorical variables within one unified model and return plausible results. We demonstrate its use via a set of case studies using multiple practical datasets.},

	abstract = {Establishing causal relations between random variables from observational data is perhaps the most important challenge in today's science. In remote sensing and geosciences, this is of special relevance to better understand the earth's system and the complex interactions between the governing processes. In this paper, we focus on an observational causal inference, and thus, we try to estimate the correct direction of causation using a finite set of empirical data. In addition, we focus on the more complex bivariate scenario that requires strong assumptions and no conditional independence tests can be used. In particular, we explore the framework of (nondeterministic) additive noise models, which relies on the principle of independence between the cause and the generating mechanism. A practical algorithmic instantiation of such principle only requires: 1) two regression models in the forward and backward directions and 2) the estimation of statistical independence between the obtained residuals and the observations. The direction leading to more independent residuals is decided to be the cause. We instead propose a criterion that uses the sensitivity (derivative) of the dependence estimator, the sensitivity criterion allows to identify samples most affecting the dependence measure, and hence, the criterion is robust to spurious detections. We illustrate the performance in a collection of 28 geoscience causal inference problems, a database of radiative transfer models simulations and machine learning emulators in vegetation parameter modeling involving 182 problems, and assessing the impact of different regression models in a carbon cycle problem. The criterion achieves the state-of-the-art detection rates in all cases, and it is generally robust to noise sources and distortions. The presented approach confirms the validity in observational bivariate problems in the earth sciences.},

Causality is a very vital concept also for investigating the dynamic surface of our living planet. However, there are not many attempts for integrating a causal model in Remote Sensing (RS) methodologies. Hence, in this paper, we propose to use patch-based RS images and to represent each patch-based image by a single variable (e.g. entropy). Then we use a Structural Equation Model (SEM) to study their cause-effect relation. Moreover, the SEM is a simple causal model characterized by a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). Its nodes are causal variables, and its edges represent causal relationships among causal variables if and only if causal variables are dependent.},

	abstract = {The Belt and Road (B\&R) initiative is proposed to promote common development among countries along the B\&R. In recent years, although the B\&R has contributed to the regions along the route, it is always a controversial topic in the international community. A number of scholars have done a set of research works to analyze the effects of the B\&R projects based on traditional economic methods. However, the drawbacks of subjectivity and delay reduce the conviction of the analysis results. In this paper, we leverage the objectivity and real-time features of remote sensing (RS) images to analyze the effects of the B\&R project. Our research takes Voi town along the Mongolia-Nairobi Railway as the representative city. In addition, in order to prove the causal relationship between the B\&r; economic development, we select the Taveta town as the comparison city. The semantic segmentation based on deep learning is applied to the multi-temporal RS images, to retrieve the economic development by automatically recognizing houses. On this basis, the construction and development of both the studied region and the comparison are quantitatively analyzed by meshing analysis and standard deviation elliptic methods. For overcoming the shortages of the conventional algorithms, a novel segmentation network based on the attention mechanism is proposed. The evaluation proves the semantic segmentation results can fully support the follow-up data analysis. In addition, the analysis results show that our work is a convincing initiative to reveal the values of the B\&R projects for economic developments in the B\&R-related regions.},

Previous studies mainly focused on finding and recognizing objects based on deep learning and statistical frameworks. Studies have not fully explored the transparent and reasonable decision-making process for the final predicted results, which is vital for civil and military applications. An explainable attention network for fine-grained ship image classification is proposed in the present study to bridge this gap. The present study seeks to increase attention to objects’ discriminative parts and explore intrinsic relationships between multiple attention parts and predicted outcomes. Several causal multi-attention maps are generated by combining the multi-head attention mechanism and structural causal model. The convolutional filters in the last layer of the network are divided into several groups, and each group is designed to express specific semantic information under supervision of the filter loss function. The results show which parts of the objects are adopted as the key factors for the network to make the final predicted outcome. In the training process, the network is designed to rapidly focus on the salient feature of objects and played a role in guiding other parts of the network to improve the explainable capability of the network without affecting the discrimination power or compromising the classification accuracy. Extensive experiments based on two public datasets show that the network is highly effective as indicated by high classification accuracy and explainable ability.},

Particularly, R is employed to infer the underlying causal relationships among both observed and latent variables from real remote sensing images. The advantages of the Graphical-GAN for synthesizing multiple categories of remote sensing images are two fold. Firstly, it considers the underlying causal relationships and captures the true data distribution of remote sensing images. Secondly, the adversarial learning generates synthetic sensing images that are similar to real ones with slight differences. Our remote sensing image synthesis scheme paves a promising way for remote sensing dataset augmentation, which is an effective means of improving the accuracy of learning models.

Recent developments in the field of causal machine learning enable the estimation of intervention impacts on an outcome of interest, for samples described by a set of observed characteristics. We introduce an extensible data-driven framework that leverages earth observations and frames agricultural land suitability as a geospatial impact assessment problem, where the estimated effects of agricultural practices on agroecosystems serve as a land suitability score and guide decision making. We formulate this as a causal machine learning task and discuss how this approach can be used for agricultural planning in a changing climate. Specifically, we extract the agricultural management practices of "crop rotation" and "landscape crop diversity" from crop type maps, account for climate and land use data, and use double machine learning to estimate their heterogeneous effect on Net Primary Productivity (NPP), within the Flanders region of Belgium from 2010 to 2020. We find that the effect of crop rotation was insignificant, while landscape crop diversity had a small negative effect on NPP. Finally, we observe considerable effect heterogeneity in space for both practices and analyze it.},

This study proposes a machine learning algorithm based on a causal inference tool, i.e., the Liang–Kleeman information flow (L-K IF) analysis, to address the challenge. For a region in the South China Sea where eddies frequently appear but unobserved, it is shown that the algorithm can reconstruct the desired mesoscale eddies in a remarkably successful way in geometry, orientation, strength, etc., while with the objective analysis interpolation or the traditional neural network technique, the results are not satisfactory.

In this article, we introduce causal inference into intelligent interpretation of RS and propose a new texture-aware causal feature extraction network (TeACFNet) for pixel-level fusion classification. Specifically, we propose a two-stage causal feature extraction (CFE) framework that helps networks learn more explicit class representations by capturing the causal relationships between multimodal heterogeneous data. In addition, to solve the problem of low-resolution land cover feature representation in RS images, we propose the refined statistical texture extraction (ReSTE) module. This module integrates the semantics of statistical textures in shallow feature maps through feature refinement, quantization, and encoding. Extensive experiments on two publicly available datasets with different modalities, including Houston2013 and Berlin datasets, demonstrate the remarkable effectiveness of our proposed method, which reaches a new state-of-the-art.},

	abstract = {Due to its highly complementary information about remote sensing, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical imagery matching have drawn much attention in recent years. Compared with traditional methods, deep learning-based SAR-optical image matching models largely rely on supervision with ground truths, where the matching accuracy suffers because of unseen image domains. To mitigate loads in burdensome labeling tasks, transferring deep learning models trained with annotated source domains to nonannotated target domains has attracted great concern. Due to the domain gap, the difference between the source and target domains is likely to deteriorate the matching accuracy on target data if the training process is directly conducted without proper domain adaptation (DA). In this research, a Siamese DA (SDA) approach with a combined loss function is developed in the context of multimodality image matching. Then, a novel rotation/scale-invariant transformation module with regression modules is designed to extract rotation/scale-equivariant features. Finally, the causal inference-based self-learning method and the multiresolution histogram matching approach are employed to enhance the unsupervised matching performance. Experimental results on the RadarSat/Planet dataset and the Sentinel-1/2 dataset demonstrate that the developed model can achieve competitive matching performance with a low overlap ratio between domains and little data labeling. By alleviating the domain discrepancy, the developed model drastically reduces the average L2 score of the unsupervised matching from 9.576 to 0.658, while the less-than-one-pixel matching error rate is enhanced from 66.3\% to 90.6\%.},

	abstract = {The increasing number and complex content of aerial images have made some recent methods based on deep learning not fit well with different aerial image processing tasks. The coarse-grained feature representation proposed by these methods is not discriminative enough. Besides, the confounding factors in the datasets and long-tailed distribution of the training data will lead to biased and spurious associations among the objects of aerial images. This study proposes a confounder-free fusion network (CFF-NET) to address the challenges. Global and local feature extraction branches are designed to capture comprehensive and fine-grained deep features from the whole image. Specifically, to extract the discriminative local feature and explore the contextual information across different regions, the models based on gated recurrent units are constructed to extract features of the image region and output the important weight of each region. Furthermore, the confounder-free object feature extraction branch is proposed to generate reasonable visual attention and provide more multigrained image information. It also eliminates the spurious and biased visual relationships of the image on the object level. Finally, the output of the three branches is combined to obtain the fusion feature representation. Extensive experiments are conducted on the three popular aerial image processing tasks: 1) image classification, 2) image retrieval, and 3) image captioning. It is found that the proposed CFF-NET achieves reasonable and state-of-the-art results, including high-level tasks such as aerial image captioning.},

Therefore, accurately measuring and predicting air pollution has been an important societal issue. With the era of big data and the development of artificial intelligence technologies, air pollution concentration is now being measured and recorded in real-time using different sensors. Studies have attempted to predict air pollution concentration using deep learning-based spatiotemporal prediction. This, in turn, is based on distance networks. In these studies, the distance network used to predict air pollution simply reflects the distance. However, since air pollutants cannot move over high mountain ranges and move according to the wind, the station network should include the effect of terrain and the wind direction. Previous studies do not consider these effects. To overcome these limitations, this study proposes a novel station network that combines distance and causality networks based on transfer entropy. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, out-of-sample experiments with an hourly dataset are performed from January 2017 to October 2020 using information from 186 stations in the Republic of Korea. The results suggest that the proposed method showed state-of-the-art performance compared to existing distance-based algorithms.},

Traditional convolutional neural networks can extract spatial structure features, but it cannot accurately express the spatial causality between image pixels. A lightweight deep learning network architecture is proposed based on causal convolution, which can effectively mine the intrinsic causality between pixels in hyperspectral images. Through comparative experiments in three public datasets, it is shown that compared with the traditional convolutional neural network, this network not only maintains the accuracy in ground objects recognition but also greatly reduces the model parameters.

The kSNR seeks to maximize the signal variance while minimizing the estimated noise variance explicitly in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (rkHs). The kSNR gives rise to considering complex signal-to-noise relations beyond additive noise models, and can be seen as a useful regularizer for feature extraction and dimensionality reduction. We show that the kSNR generalizes kernel PCA (and other spectral dimensionality reduction methods), least squares SVM, and kernel ridge regression to deal with cases where signal and noise cannot be assumed independent. We give computationally efficient alternatives based on reduced-rank Nystrom and projection on random Fourier features approximations, and analyze the bounds of performance and its stability. We illustrate the method through different examples, including nonlinear regression, nonlinear classification in channel equalization, nonlinear feature extraction from high-dimensional spectral satellite images, and bivariate causal inference.

	abstract = {Introduction This article proposes a novel method for matching places based on visual similarity, using high-resolution satellite imagery and machine learning. This approach strengthens comparisons when the built environment is a potential confounder, as in many injury research studies. Methods As an example, I apply this method to study the spatial influence of alcohol outlets (AOs) on firearm violence in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, specifically beer stores and bar/restaurants. Using a case-control framework, city blocks with shootings in 2017-2018 were matched with similar-looking blocks with no shootings, based on analysis with a pretrained convolutional neural network and t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding. Logistic regression was used to estimate the OR of a shooting on the same block as an AO and within one-block and two-block distances, conditional on additional factors such as land use, demographic composition and illegal drug activity. Results The case-control matches were similar in visual appearance, on human inspection, and were well balanced on covariate measures. The fully adjusted model estimated an increased shootings risk for locations with beer stores within one block, OR=1.5, 95\% CI 1.1 to 2.1, p=0.02, and locations with bar/restaurants on the same block, OR=1.6, 95\% CI 1.1 to 2.4, p=0.02. Conclusion These findings align with previous study findings while addressing the concern that AOs might systematically be located in certain kinds of environments, providing stronger evidence of a causal effect on nearby firearm violence. Matching on visual similarity can improve observational injury studies involving place-based risks.},

	abstract = {Environmental and ecological risk assessments are defined as the process for evaluating the likelihood that the environment may be impacted as a result of exposure to stressors. Although this definition implies the calculation of probabilities, risk assessments traditionally rely on nonprobabilistic methods such as calculation of a risk quotient. Bayesian network (BN) models are a tool for probabilistic and causal modeling, increasingly used in many fields of environmental science. Bayesian networks are defined as directed acyclic graphs where the causal relationships and the associated uncertainty are quantified in conditional probability tables. Bayesian networks inherently incorporate uncertainty and can integrate a variety of information types, including expert elicitation. During the last 2 decades, there has been a steady increase in reports on BN applications in environmental risk assessment and management. At recent annual meetings of the Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry (SETAC) North America and SETAC Europe, a number of applications of BN models were presented along with new theoretical developments. Likewise, recent meetings of the European Geosciences Union (EGU) have dedicated sessions to Bayesian modeling in relation to water quality. This special series contains 10 articles based on presentations in these sessions, reflecting a range of BN applications to systems, ranging from cells and populations to watersheds and national scale. The articles report on recent progress in many topics, including climate and management scenarios, ecological and socioeconomic endpoints, machine learning, diagnostic inference, and model evaluation. They demonstrate that BNs can be adapted to established conceptual frameworks used to support environmental risk assessments, such as adverse outcome pathways and the relative risk model. The contributions from EGU demonstrate recent advancements in areas such as spatial (geographic information system [GIS]-based) and temporal (dynamic) BN modeling. In conclusion, this special series supports the prediction that increased use of Bayesian network models will improve environmental risk assessments. Integr Environ Assess Manag 2020;00:1-9.

	abstract = {The ecological and environmental science communities have embraced machine learning (ML) for empirical modelling and prediction. However, going beyond prediction to draw insights into underlying functional relationships between response variables and environmental 'drivers' is less straightforward. Deriving ecological insights from fitted ML models requires techniques to extract the 'learning' hidden in the ML models. We revisit the theoretical background and effectiveness of four approaches for deriving insights from ML: ranking independent variable importance (Gini importance, GI; permutation importance, PI; split importance, SI; and conditional permutation importance, CPI), and two approaches for inference of bivariate functional relationships (partial dependence plots, PDP; and accumulated local effect plots, ALE). We also explore the use of a surrogate model for visualization and interpretation of complex multi-variate relationships between response variables and environmental drivers. We examine the challenges and opportunities for extracting ecological insights with these interpretation approaches. Specifically, we aim to improve interpretation of ML models by investigating how effectiveness relates to (a) interpretation algorithm, (b) sample size and (c) the presence of spurious explanatory variables. We base the analysis on simulations with known underlying functional relationships between response and predictor variables, with added white noise and the presence of correlated but non-influential variables. The results indicate that deriving ecological insight is strongly affected by interpretation algorithm and spurious variables, and moderately impacted by sample size. Removing spurious variables improves interpretation of ML models. Meanwhile, increasing sample size has limited value in the presence of spurious variables, but increasing sample size does improves performance once spurious variables are omitted. Among the four ranking methods, SI is slightly more effective than the other methods in the presence of spurious variables, while GI and SI yield higher accuracy when spurious variables are removed. PDP is more effective in retrieving underlying functional relationships than ALE, but its reliability declines sharply in the presence of spurious variables. Visualization and interpretation of the interactive effects of predictors and the response variable can be enhanced using surrogate models, including three-dimensional visualizations and use of loess planes to represent independent variable effects and interactions. Machine learning analysts should be aware that including correlated independent variables in ML models with no clear causal relationship to response variables can interfere with ecological inference. When ecological inference is important, ML models should be constructed with independent variables that have clear causal effects on response variables. While interpreting ML models for ecological inference remains challenging, we show that careful choice of interpretation methods, exclusion of spurious variables and adequate sample size can provide more and better opportunities to 'learn from machine learning'.},

	abstract = {A deep learning (DL) model learns a function relating a set of input variables with a set of target variables. While the representation of this function in form of the DL model often lacks interpretability, several interpretation methods exist that provide descriptions of the function (e.g., measures of feature importance). On the one hand, these descriptions may build trust in the model or reveal its limitations. On the other hand, they may lead to new scientific understanding. In any case, a description is only useful if one is able to identify if parts of it reflect spurious instead of causal relations (e.g., random associations in the training data instead of associations due to a physical process). However, this can be challenging even for experts because, in scientific tasks, causal relations between input and target variables are often unknown or extremely complex. Commonly, this challenge is addressed by training separate instances of the considered model on random samples of the training set and identifying differences between the obtained descriptions. Here, we demonstrate that this may not be sufficient and propose to additionally consider more general modifications of the prediction task. We refer to the proposed approach as variant approach and demonstrate its usefulness and its superiority over pure sampling approaches with two illustrative prediction tasks from hydrometeorology. While being conceptually simple, to our knowledge the approach has not been formalized and systematically evaluated before.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Analysis of urban area function is crucial for urban development. Urban area function features can help to conduct better urban planning and transportation planning. With development of urbanization, urban area function becomes complex. In order to accurately extract function features, researchers have proposed multisource data mining methods that combine urban remote sensing and other data. Therefore, the research of efficient multisource data analysis tools has become a new hot topic. In this paper, a novel urban data analysis method combining spatiotemporal wireless network data and remote sensing data was proposed. First, a Voronoi-diagram-based method was used to divide the urban remote sensing images into zones. Second, we combined period and trend components of wireless network traffic data to mine urban function structure. Third, for multisource supported urban simulation, we designed a novel spatiotemporal city computing method combining graph attention network (GAT) and gated recurrent unit (GRU) to analyze spatiotemporal urban data. The final results prove that our method performs better than other commonly used methods. In addition, we calculated the commuting index of each zone by wireless network data. Combined with the urban simulation conducted in this paper, the dynamic changes of urban area features can be sensed in advance for a better sustainable urban development.},

Causal inference provides the theoretical foundations to use data and qualitative domain knowledge to quantitatively answer these questions, complementing statistics and machine learning techniques. However, there is still a broad language gap between the methodological and domain science communities. In this Technical Review, we explain the use of causal inference frameworks with a focus on the challenges of time series data. Domain-adapted explanations, method guidance and practical case studies provide an accessible summary of methods for causal discovery and causal effect estimation. Examples from climate and biogeosciences illustrate typical challenges, such as contemporaneous causation, hidden confounding and non-stationarity, and some strategies to address these challenges. Integrating causal thinking into data-driven science will facilitate process understanding and more robust machine learning and statistical models for Earth and environmental sciences, enabling the tackling of many open problems with relevant environmental, economic and societal implications. Earth sciences often investigate the causal relationships between processes and events, but there is confusion about the correct use of methods to learn these relationships from data. This Technical Review explains the application of causal inference techniques to time series and demonstrates its use through two examples of climate and biosphere-related investigations.},

	abstract = {Multi-temporal high spatial resolution earth observation makes it possible to detect complex urban land surface changes, which is a significant and challenging task in remote sensing communities. Previous works mainly focus on binary change detection (BCD) based on modern technologies, e.g., deep fully convolutional network (FCN), whereas the deep network architecture for semantic change detection (SCD) is insufficiently explored in current literature. In this paper, we propose a deep multi-task encoder-transformer-decoder architecture (ChangeMask) designed by exploring two important inductive biases: sematic-change causal relationship and temporal sym­ metry. ChangeMask decouples the SCD into a temporal-wise semantic segmentation and a BCD, and then in­ tegrates these two tasks into a general encoder-transformer-decoder framework. In the encoder part, we design a semantic-aware encoder to model the semantic-change causal relationship. This encoder is only used to learn semantic representation and then learn change representation from semantic representation via a later trans­ former module. In this way, change representation can constrain semantic representation during training, which introduces a regularization to reduce the risk of overfitting. To learn a robust change representation from se­ mantic representation, we propose a temporal-symmetric transformer (TST) to guarantee temporal symmetry for change representation and keep it discriminative. Based on the above semantic representation and change representation, we adopt simple multi-task decoders to output semantic change map. Benefiting from the differentiable building blocks, ChangeMask can be trained by a multi-task loss function, which significantly simplifies the whole pipeline of applying ChangeMask. The comprehensive experimental results on two largescale SCD datasets confirm the effectiveness and superiority of ChangeMask in SCD. Besides, to demonstrate the potential value in real-world applications, e.g., automatic urban analysis and decision-making, we deploy the ChangeMask to map a large geographic area covering 30 km2 with 300 million pixels.

Specifically, the directed acyclic graph-graph neural network (DAG-GNN) method is first applied to quantify the causality among multiple ocean-atmosphere-biology variables for selecting the most significant predictors of the red tides (or other chlorophyll variations). Then, the encoder-decoder model consisting of an Energy Attention Module (EAM) is built for daily red tide forecasting. The multisourced multivariate dataset during 2010–2020 covering the East China Sea serves to train and evaluate PIRT. The experimental results demonstrate that the predictors in the learned causal graph are closely related to the occurrence and decay of red tides, which exhibits high physical interpretability. PIRT has a superior forecasting skill, the predictions of which are with highly consistent spatial patterns, especially in extreme events. The seven-lead-day forecast errors for chlorophyll are within 0.9 {\textbackslash}textmg{\textbackslash}cdot{\textbackslash}textm{\textasciicircum}-3 , which is much better than the other models. This also indicates that PIRT can be used as a reliable tool to study the ecology of the East China Sea.},

PV panel detection and counting are crucial for monitoring solar energy development and policy evaluation. Recent studies have effectively utilized DL to segment PV panels in high-resolution remote sensing images. However, the acquisition of such images can be prohibitively expensive due to the extensive data needed to train DL models. To address these issues, we develop an efficient method for segmenting PV panels from low-res aerial images. We utilize the publicly available low-res aerial images of Taiwan from the National Land Surveying and Cartography Center (NLSC), greatly reducing data acquisition costs. U-Net with a pre-trained Transformer-based model is adopted as the encoder for PV panel segmentation, where the transfer learning design can effectively reduce the training requirement. Evaluations show that DeepPVMap achieves a high IoU score of 91.58\%, effectively generating a complete PV panel segmentation for the entire Taiwan island (36 K km², about 11 M tiles with 716,081 M pixels) in 10 hours. We show that our approach can accelerate the manual PV panel identification and annotation process by about 7× compared to manual annotation. This research represents a new large-scale study of automatic PV panel segmentation from low-res aerial images using advanced U-Net and Transformer models that will advance sustainable energy development.},

	abstract = {Hybrid modeling integrates machine learning with scientific knowledge to enhance interpretability, generalization, and adherence to natural laws. Nevertheless, equifinality and regularization biases pose challenges in hybrid modeling to achieve these purposes. This paper introduces a novel approach to estimating hybrid models via a causal inference framework, specifically employing Double Machine Learning (DML) to estimate causal effects. We showcase its use for the Earth sciences on two problems related to carbon dioxide fluxes. In the \$Q\_\{10\}\$ model, we demonstrate that DML-based hybrid modeling is superior in estimating causal parameters over end-to-end deep neural network (DNN) approaches, proving efficiency, robustness to bias from regularization methods, and circumventing equifinality. Our approach, applied to carbon flux partitioning, exhibits flexibility in accommodating heterogeneous causal effects. The study emphasizes the necessity of explicitly defining causal graphs and relationships, advocating for this as a general best practice. We encourage the continued exploration of causality in hybrid models for more interpretable and trustworthy results in knowledge-guided machine learning.},

Using the sensor data, we preserve underlying causal relations among sensor attributes and organic matter. Simultaneously we leverage inherent structure in the data and train the model to discriminate among domains using contrastive learning. This causal and contrastive constraint minimization ensures improved generalization and adaptation to other domains. We also shed light on the interpretability of the framework by identifying attributes that are important for improving generalization.

	abstract = {In order to improve climate projections, machine learning (ML)-based parameterizations have been developed for Earth System Models (ESMs) with the goal to better represent subgrid-scale processes or to accelerate computations by emulating existent parameterizations. These data-driven models have shown some success in approximating subgrid-scale processes. However, most studies have used a particular machine learning method to parameterize the subgrid tendencies or fluxes originating from the compound effect of various small-scale processes (e.g., turbulence, radiation, convection, gravity waves) in mostly idealized settings or from superparameterizations. Here, we use a filtering technique to explicitly separate convection from these processes in data produced by the Icosahedral Non-hydrostatic modelling framework (ICON) in a realistic setting. We use a method improved by incorporating density fluctuations for computing the subgrid fluxes and compare various different machine learning algorithms to predict these fluxes. We further examine the predictions of the best performing non-deep learning model (Gradient Boosted Tree regression) and the best deep-learning model (U-Net). We discover that the U-Net learns non-causal relations between convective precipitation and convective subgrid fluxes and develop an ablated model excluding precipitating tracer species. We connect the learned relations of the U-Net to physical processes in contrast to non-deep learning-based algorithms. The ML schemes are coupled online to the host ICON model and the non-causal links reveal weaknesses in stability and precipitation predictions. Predicted precipitation extremes of the ablated U-Net show higher accuracy over the conventional convection parameterization. Thus, our results provide a significant advance upon existing ML subgrid representation in ESMs.},

	abstract = {Accurate hydrological understanding and water cycle prediction are crucial for addressing scientific and societal challenges associated with the management of water resources, particularly under the dynamic influence of anthropogenic climate change. Existing reviews predominantly concentrate on the development of machine learning (ML) in this field, yet there is a clear distinction between hydrology and ML as separate paradigms. Here, we introduce physics-aware ML as a transformative approach to overcome the perceived barrier and revolutionize both fields. Specifically, we present a comprehensive review of the physics-aware ML methods, building a structured community (PaML) of existing methodologies that integrate prior physical knowledge or physics-based modeling into ML. We systematically analyze these PaML methodologies with respect to four aspects: physical data-guided ML, physics-informed ML, physics-embedded ML, and physics-aware hybrid learning. PaML facilitates ML-aided hypotheses, accelerating insights from big data and fostering scientific discoveries. We first conduct a systematic review of hydrology in PaML, including rainfall-runoff hydrological processes and hydrodynamic processes, and highlight the most promising and challenging directions for different objectives and PaML methods. Finally, a new PaML-based hydrology platform, termed HydroPML, is released as a foundation for hydrological applications. HydroPML enhances the explainability and causality of ML and lays the groundwork for the digital water cycle's realization.

Compared to optical satellite imageries, the Synthetic Aperture Radar can penetrate cloud cover and provide more complete spatial coverage of damaged zones in various weather conditions. However, these InSAR imageries often contain highly noisy and mixed signals induced by co-occurring or co-located building damage, flood, flood/wind-induced vegetation changes, as well as anthropogenic activities, making it challenging to extract accurate building damage information. In this paper, we introduced an approach for rapid post-hurricane building damage detection from InSAR imagery. This approach encoded complex causal dependencies among wind, flood, building damage, and InSAR imagery using a holistic causal Bayesian network. Based on the causal Bayesian network, we further jointly inferred the large-scale unobserved building damage by fusing the information from InSAR imagery with prior physical models of flood and wind, without the need for ground truth labels. Furthermore, we validated our estimation results in a real-world devastating hurricane -- the 2022 Hurricane Ian. We gathered and annotated building damage ground truth data in Lee County, Florida, and compared the introduced method's estimation results with the ground truth and benchmarked it against state-of-the-art models to assess the effectiveness of our proposed method. Results show that our method achieves rapid and accurate detection of building damage, with significantly reduced processing time compared to traditional manual inspection methods.},

One set of functions enables image-based causal inference analyses. For example, one key function decomposes treatment effect heterogeneity by images using an interpretable Bayesian framework. This allows for determining which types of images or image sequences are most responsive to interventions. A second modeling function allows researchers to control for confounding using images. The package also allows investigators to produce embeddings that serve as vector summaries of the image or video content. Finally, infrastructural functions are also provided, such as tools for writing large-scale image and image sequence data as sequentialized byte strings for more rapid image analysis. causalimages therefore opens new capabilities for causal inference in R, letting researchers use informative imagery in substantive analyses in a fast and accessible manner.},

Granger causality has been widely used in many applied disciplines, from neuroscience and econometrics to Earth sciences. We revisit GC under a graphical perspective of state-space models. For that, we use GraphEM, a recently presented expectation-maximisation algorithm for estimating the linear matrix operator in the state equation of a linear-Gaussian state-space model. Lasso regularisation is included in the M-step, which is solved using a proximal splitting Douglas-Rachford algorithm.

We study the impact of crop diversification on productivity in the context of climate change. We leverage heterogeneous Earth Observation data and contribute a data-driven approach based on causal machine learning for understanding how crop diversification impacts may change in the future. We apply this method to the country of Cyprus throughout a 4-year period. We find that, on average, crop diversification significantly benefited the net primary productivity of crops, increasing it by 2.8\%. The effect generally synergized well with higher maximum temperatures and lower soil moistures. In a warmer and more drought-prone climate, we conclude that crop diversification exhibits promising adaptation potential and is thus a sensible policy choice with regards to agricultural productivity for present and future.},

	abstract = {Learning causal graphs from multivariate time series is a ubiquitous challenge in all application domains dealing with time-dependent systems, such as in Earth sciences, biology, or engineering, to name a few. Recent developments for this causal discovery learning task have shown considerable skill, notably the specific time-series adaptations of the popular conditional independence-based learning framework. However, uncertainty estimation is challenging for conditional independence-based methods. Here, we introduce a novel bootstrap approach designed for time series causal discovery that preserves the temporal dependencies and lag structure. It can be combined with a range of time series causal discovery methods and provides a measure of confidence for the links of the time series graphs. Furthermore, next to confidence estimation, an aggregation, also called bagging, of the bootstrapped graphs by majority voting results in bagged causal discovery methods. In this work, we combine this approach with the state-of-the-art conditional-independence-based algorithm PCMCI+. With extensive numerical experiments we empirically demonstrate that, in addition to providing confidence measures for links, Bagged-PCMCI+ improves in precision and recall as compared to its base algorithm PCMCI+, at the cost of higher computational demands. These statistical performance improvements are especially pronounced in the more challenging settings (short time sample size, large number of variables, high autocorrelation). Our bootstrap approach can also be combined with other time series causal discovery algorithms and can be of considerable use in many real-world applications.},

	abstract = {Time-series datasets are central in numerous fields of science and engineering, such as biomedicine, Earth observation, and network analysis. Extensive research exists on state-space models (SSMs), which are powerful mathematical tools that allow for probabilistic and interpretable learning on time series. Estimating the model parameters in SSMs is arguably one of the most complicated tasks, and the inclusion of prior knowledge is known to both ease the interpretation but also to complicate the inferential tasks. Very recent works have attempted to incorporate a graphical perspective on some of those model parameters, but they present notable limitations that this work addresses. More generally, existing graphical modeling tools are designed to incorporate either static information, focusing on statistical dependencies among independent random variables (e.g., graphical Lasso approach), or dynamic information, emphasizing causal relationships among time series samples (e.g., graphical Granger approaches). However, there are no joint approaches combining static and dynamic graphical modeling within the context of SSMs. This work proposes a novel approach to fill this gap by introducing a joint graphical modeling framework that bridges the static graphical Lasso model and a causal-based graphical approach for the linear-Gaussian SSM. We present DGLASSO (Dynamic Graphical Lasso), a new inference method within this framework that implements an efficient block alternating majorization-minimization algorithm. The algorithm's convergence is established by departing from modern tools from nonlinear analysis. Experimental validation on synthetic and real weather variability data showcases the effectiveness of the proposed model and inference algorithm.},

	abstract = {Causality has the potential to truly transform the way we solve a large number of real-world problems. Yet, so far, its potential largely remains to be unlocked as causality often requires crucial assumptions which cannot be tested in practice. To address this challenge, we propose a new way of thinking about causality -- we call this causal deep learning. Our causal deep learning framework spans three dimensions: (1) a structural dimension, which incorporates partial yet testable causal knowledge rather than assuming either complete or no causal knowledge among the variables of interest; (2) a parametric dimension, which encompasses parametric forms that capture the type of relationships among the variables of interest; and (3) a temporal dimension, which captures exposure times or how the variables of interest interact (possibly causally) over time. Causal deep learning enables us to make progress on a variety of real-world problems by leveraging partial causal knowledge (including independencies among variables) and quantitatively characterising causal relationships among variables of interest (possibly over time). Our framework clearly identifies which assumptions are testable and which ones are not, such that the resulting solutions can be judiciously adopted in practice. Using our formulation we can combine or chain together causal representations to solve specific problems without losing track of which assumptions are required to build these solutions, pushing real-world impact in healthcare, economics and business, environmental sciences and education, through causal deep learning.},

In the setting where the observed variables are tabular quantities such as average income in a neighborhood, tools have been developed for addressing such confounding.

In this context, satellite imagery can play an important role, serving as a proxy for the confounding variables otherwise unobserved. In this paper, we study confounder adjustment in this non-tabular setting, where patterns or objects found in satellite images contribute to the confounder bias. Using the evaluation of anti-poverty aid programs in Africa as our running example, we formalize the challenge of performing causal adjustment with such unstructured data -- what conditions are sufficient to identify causal effects, how to perform estimation, and how to quantify the ways in which certain aspects of the unstructured image object are most predictive of the treatment decision. Via simulation, we also explore the sensitivity of satellite image-based observational inference to image resolution and to misspecification of the image-associated confounder. Finally, we apply these tools in estimating the effect of anti-poverty interventions in African communities from satellite imagery.},

Here we show that transfer entropy-based causal graphs, which have recently become popular in the earth sciences with high-profile discoveries, can be spurious even when augmented with statistical significance.

It is also a precursor of tropospheric ozone which damages crops and deteriorates human health. Study of HCHO chemistry and long-term monitoring using satellite data is important from the perspective of human health, food security and air pollution. Dynamic atmospheric chemistry models struggle to simulate atmospheric formaldehyde and often overestimate by up to two times relative to satellite observations and reanalysis. Spatial distribution of modelled HCHO also fail to match satellite observations. Here, we present deep learning approach using a simple super-resolution based convolutional neural network towards simulating fast and reliable atmospheric HCHO. Our approach is an indirect method of HCHO estimation without the need to chemical equations. We find that deep learning outperforms dynamical model simulations which involves complicated atmospheric chemistry representation. Causality establishing the nonlinear relationships of different variables to target formaldehyde is established in our approach by using a variety of precursors from meteorology and chemical reanalysis to target OMI AURA satellite based HCHO predictions. We choose South Asia for testing our implementation as it doesnt have in situ measurements of formaldehyde and there is a need for improved quality data over the region. Moreover, there are spatial and temporal data gaps in the satellite product which can be removed by trustworthy modelling of atmospheric formaldehyde.

	abstract = {This paper introduces causal scoring as a novel approach to frame causal estimation in the context of decision making. Causal scoring entails the estimation of scores that support decision making by providing insights into causal effects. We present three valuable causal interpretations of these scores: effect estimation (EE), effect ordering (EO), and effect classification (EC). In the EE interpretation, the causal score represents the effect itself. The EO interpretation implies that the score can serve as a proxy for the magnitude of the effect, enabling the sorting of individuals based on their causal effects. The EC interpretation enables the classification of individuals into high- and low-effect categories using a predefined threshold. We demonstrate the value of these alternative causal interpretations (EO and EC) through two key results. First, we show that aligning the statistical modeling with the desired causal interpretation improves the accuracy of causal estimation. Second, we establish that more flexible causal interpretations are plausible in a wider range of settings and propose conditions to assess their validity. We showcase the practical utility of causal scoring through diverse scenarios, including situations involving unobserved confounding due to self-selection, lack of data on the primary outcome of interest, or lack of data on how individuals behave when intervened. These examples illustrate how causal scoring facilitates reasoning about flexible causal interpretations of statistical estimates in various contexts. They encompass confounded estimates, effect estimates on surrogate outcomes, and even predictions about non-causal quantities as potential causal scores.},

However, in public policy, ecology, and in medicine, decisions are often made in non-tabular settings, informed by patterns or objects detected in images (e.g., maps, satellite or tomography imagery). Using such imagery for causal inference presents an opportunity because objects in the image may be related to the treatment and outcome of interest. In these cases, we rely on the images to adjust for confounding but observed data do not directly label the existence of the important objects. Motivated by real-world applications, we formalize this challenge, how it can be handled, and what conditions are sufficient to identify and estimate causal effects. We analyze finite-sample performance using simulation experiments, estimating effects using a propensity adjustment algorithm that employs a machine learning model to estimate the image confounding. Our experiments also examine sensitivity to misspecification of the image pattern mechanism.

	abstract = {Atmospheric correction is a fundamental task in remote sensing because observations are taken either of the atmosphere or looking through the atmosphere. Atmospheric correction errors can significantly alter the spectral signature of the observations, and lead to invalid classifications or target detection. This is even more crucial when working with hyperspectral data, where a precise measurement of spectral properties is required. State-of-the-art physics-based atmospheric correction approaches require extensive prior knowledge about sensor characteristics, collection geometry, and environmental characteristics of the scene being collected. These approaches are computationally expensive, prone to inaccuracy due to lack of sufficient environmental and collection information, and often impossible for real-time applications. In this paper, a geometry-dependent hybrid neural network is proposed for automatic atmospheric correction using multi-scan hyperspectral data collected from different geometries. The proposed network can characterize the atmosphere without any additional meteorological data. A grid-search method is also proposed to solve the temperature emissivity separation problem. Results show that the proposed network has the capacity to accurately characterize the atmosphere and estimate target emissivity spectra with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) under 0.02 for 29 different materials. This solution can lead to accurate atmospheric correction to improve target detection for real time applications.},

	abstract = {Global warming is leading to unprecedented changes in our planet, with great societal, economical and environmental implications, especially with the growing demand of biofuels and food. Assessing the impact of climate on vegetation is of pressing need. We approached the attribution problem with a novel nonlinear Granger causal (GC) methodology and used a large data archive of remote sensing satellite products, environmental and climatic variables spatio-temporally gridded over more than 30 years. We generalize kernel Granger causality by considering the variables cross-relations explicitly in Hilbert spaces, and use the covariance in Gaussian processes. The method generalizes the linear and kernel GC methods, and comes with tighter bounds of performance based on Rademacher complexity. Spatially-explicit global Granger footprints of precipitation and soil moisture on vegetation greenness are identified more sharply than previous GC methods.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.09573},
	abstract = {In this article, we describe the algorithms for causal structure learning from time series data that won the Causality 4 Climate competition at the Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems 2019 (NeurIPS). We examine how our combination of established ideas achieves competitive performance on semi-realistic and realistic time series data exhibiting common challenges in real-world Earth sciences data. In particular, we discuss a) a rationale for leveraging linear methods to identify causal links in non-linear systems, b) a simulation-backed explanation as to why large regression coefficients may predict causal links better in practice than small p-values and thus why normalising the data may sometimes hinder causal structure learning. For benchmark usage, we detail the algorithms here and provide implementations at https://github.com/sweichwald/tidybench . We propose the presented competition-proven methods for baseline benchmark comparisons to guide the development of novel algorithms for structure learning from time series.},

	title = {Causal inference for climate change events from satellite image time series using computer vision and deep learning},
	abstract = {We propose a method for causal inference using satellite image time series, in order to determine the treatment effects of interventions which impact climate change, such as deforestation. Simply put, the aim is to quantify the ‘before versus after’ effect of climate related human driven interventions, such as urbanization; as well as natural disasters, such as hurricanes and forest fires. As a concrete example, we focus on quantifying forest tree cover change/ deforestation due to human led causes. The proposed method involves the following steps. First, we uae computer vision and machine learning/deep learning techniques to detect and quantify forest tree coverage levels over time, at every time epoch. We then look at this time series to identify changepoints. Next, we estimate the expected (forest tree cover) values using a Bayesian structural causal model and projecting/forecasting the counterfactual. This is compared to the values actually observed post intervention, and the difference in the two values gives us the effect of the intervention (as compared to the non intervention scenario, i.e. what would have possibly happened without the intervention). As a specific use case, we analyze deforestation levels before and after the hyperinflation event (intervention) in Brazil (which ended in 1993-94), for the Amazon rainforest region, around Rondonia, Brazil. For this deforestation use case, using our causal inference framework can help causally attribute change/reduction in forest tree cover and increasing deforestation rates due to human activities at various points in time.},
