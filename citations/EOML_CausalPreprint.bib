	abstract = {We present DeepPVMap, a Deep Learning (DL) system that detects and segments Photovoltaic (PV) panels out of low-resolution (50 cm) aerial imagery for efficient extraction and counting of PV or solar panels. PV panel detection and counting are crucial for monitoring solar energy development and policy evaluation. Recent studies have effectively utilized DL to segment PV panels in high-resolution remote sensing images. However, the acquisition of such images can be prohibitively expensive due to the extensive data needed to train DL models. To address these issues, we develop an efficient method for segmenting PV panels from low-res aerial images. We utilize the publicly available low-res aerial images of Taiwan from the National Land Surveying and Cartography Center (NLSC), greatly reducing data acquisition costs. U-Net with a pre-trained Transformer-based model is adopted as the encoder for PV panel segmentation, where the transfer learning design can effectively reduce the training requirement. Evaluations show that DeepPVMap achieves a high IoU score of 91.58\%, effectively generating a complete PV panel segmentation for the entire Taiwan island (36 K km², about 11 M tiles with 716,081 M pixels) in 10 hours. We show that our approach can accelerate the manual PV panel identification and annotation process by about 7× compared to manual annotation. This research represents a new large-scale study of automatic PV panel segmentation from low-res aerial images using advanced U-Net and Transformer models that will advance sustainable energy development.},

	abstract = {Hybrid modeling integrates machine learning with scientific knowledge to enhance interpretability, generalization, and adherence to natural laws. Nevertheless, equifinality and regularization biases pose challenges in hybrid modeling to achieve these purposes. This paper introduces a novel approach to estimating hybrid models via a causal inference framework, specifically employing Double Machine Learning (DML) to estimate causal effects. We showcase its use for the Earth sciences on two problems related to carbon dioxide fluxes. In the \$Q\_\{10\}\$ model, we demonstrate that DML-based hybrid modeling is superior in estimating causal parameters over end-to-end deep neural network (DNN) approaches, proving efficiency, robustness to bias from regularization methods, and circumventing equifinality. Our approach, applied to carbon flux partitioning, exhibits flexibility in accommodating heterogeneous causal effects. The study emphasizes the necessity of explicitly defining causal graphs and relationships, advocating for this as a general best practice. We encourage the continued exploration of causality in hybrid models for more interpretable and trustworthy results in knowledge-guided machine learning.},

Using the sensor data, we preserve underlying causal relations among sensor attributes and organic matter. Simultaneously we leverage inherent structure in the data and train the model to discriminate among domains using contrastive learning. This causal and contrastive constraint minimization ensures improved generalization and adaptation to other domains. We also shed light on the interpretability of the framework by identifying attributes that are important for improving generalization. Identifying these key soil attributes that affect organic matter will aid in efforts to standardize data collection efforts.},

The algorithm's accuracy is validated against annual survey data, establishing its reliability for ongoing monitoring. The paper then proceeds with the empirical analysis, revealing statistically significant cointegration and one-way causal relationships between the increased availability of subsidized mortgage loans and the decreased number of households living in poor housing conditions across areas. Specifically, a one percent increase in subsidized loans to Ger-populated areas corresponds to a 0.35 percent reduction in Ger residency. These findings underscore the subsidized mortgage program's effectiveness as a policy instrument.},

	abstract = {In order to improve climate projections, machine learning (ML)-based parameterizations have been developed for Earth System Models (ESMs) with the goal to better represent subgrid-scale processes or to accelerate computations by emulating existent parameterizations. These data-driven models have shown some success in approximating subgrid-scale processes. However, most studies have used a particular machine learning method to parameterize the subgrid tendencies or fluxes originating from the compound effect of various small-scale processes (e.g., turbulence, radiation, convection, gravity waves) in mostly idealized settings or from superparameterizations. Here, we use a filtering technique to explicitly separate convection from these processes in data produced by the Icosahedral Non-hydrostatic modelling framework (ICON) in a realistic setting. We use a method improved by incorporating density fluctuations for computing the subgrid fluxes and compare various different machine learning algorithms to predict these fluxes. We further examine the predictions of the best performing non-deep learning model (Gradient Boosted Tree regression) and the best deep-learning model (U-Net). We discover that the U-Net learns non-causal relations between convective precipitation and convective subgrid fluxes and develop an ablated model excluding precipitating tracer species. We connect the learned relations of the U-Net to physical processes in contrast to non-deep learning-based algorithms. The ML schemes are coupled online to the host ICON model and the non-causal links reveal weaknesses in stability and precipitation predictions. Predicted precipitation extremes of the ablated U-Net show higher accuracy over the conventional convection parameterization. Thus, our results provide a significant advance upon existing ML subgrid representation in ESMs.},

	abstract = {Accurate hydrological understanding and water cycle prediction are crucial for addressing scientific and societal challenges associated with the management of water resources, particularly under the dynamic influence of anthropogenic climate change. Existing reviews predominantly concentrate on the development of machine learning (ML) in this field, yet there is a clear distinction between hydrology and ML as separate paradigms. Here, we introduce physics-aware ML as a transformative approach to overcome the perceived barrier and revolutionize both fields. Specifically, we present a comprehensive review of the physics-aware ML methods, building a structured community (PaML) of existing methodologies that integrate prior physical knowledge or physics-based modeling into ML. We systematically analyze these PaML methodologies with respect to four aspects: physical data-guided ML, physics-informed ML, physics-embedded ML, and physics-aware hybrid learning. PaML facilitates ML-aided hypotheses, accelerating insights from big data and fostering scientific discoveries. We first conduct a systematic review of hydrology in PaML, including rainfall-runoff hydrological processes and hydrodynamic processes, and highlight the most promising and challenging directions for different objectives and PaML methods. Finally, a new PaML-based hydrology platform, termed HydroPML, is released as a foundation for hydrological applications. HydroPML enhances the explainability and causality of ML and lays the groundwork for the digital water cycle's realization. The HydroPML platform is publicly available at https://hydropml.github.io/.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01565},
	abstract = {Timely and accurate assessment of hurricane-induced building damage is crucial for effective post-hurricane response and recovery efforts. Recently, remote sensing technologies provide large-scale optical or Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) imagery data immediately after a disastrous event, which can be readily used to conduct rapid building damage assessment. Compared to optical satellite imageries, the Synthetic Aperture Radar can penetrate cloud cover and provide more complete spatial coverage of damaged zones in various weather conditions. However, these InSAR imageries often contain highly noisy and mixed signals induced by co-occurring or co-located building damage, flood, flood/wind-induced vegetation changes, as well as anthropogenic activities, making it challenging to extract accurate building damage information. In this paper, we introduced an approach for rapid post-hurricane building damage detection from InSAR imagery. This approach encoded complex causal dependencies among wind, flood, building damage, and InSAR imagery using a holistic causal Bayesian network. Based on the causal Bayesian network, we further jointly inferred the large-scale unobserved building damage by fusing the information from InSAR imagery with prior physical models of flood and wind, without the need for ground truth labels. Furthermore, we validated our estimation results in a real-world devastating hurricane -- the 2022 Hurricane Ian. We gathered and annotated building damage ground truth data in Lee County, Florida, and compared the introduced method's estimation results with the ground truth and benchmarked it against state-of-the-art models to assess the effectiveness of our proposed method. Results show that our method achieves rapid and accurate detection of building damage, with significantly reduced processing time compared to traditional manual inspection methods.},

We leverage heterogeneous Earth Observation data and contribute a data-driven approach based on causal machine learning for understanding how crop diversification impacts may change in the future. We apply this method to the country of Cyprus throughout a 4-year period. We find that, on average, crop diversification significantly benefited the net primary productivity of crops, increasing it by 2.8\%. The effect generally synergized well with higher maximum temperatures and lower soil moistures. In a warmer and more drought-prone climate, we conclude that crop diversification exhibits promising adaptation potential and is thus a sensible policy choice with regards to agricultural productivity for present and future.},

	abstract = {Learning causal graphs from multivariate time series is a ubiquitous challenge in all application domains dealing with time-dependent systems, such as in Earth sciences, biology, or engineering, to name a few. Recent developments for this causal discovery learning task have shown considerable skill, notably the specific time-series adaptations of the popular conditional independence-based learning framework. However, uncertainty estimation is challenging for conditional independence-based methods. Here, we introduce a novel bootstrap approach designed for time series causal discovery that preserves the temporal dependencies and lag structure. It can be combined with a range of time series causal discovery methods and provides a measure of confidence for the links of the time series graphs. Furthermore, next to confidence estimation, an aggregation, also called bagging, of the bootstrapped graphs by majority voting results in bagged causal discovery methods. In this work, we combine this approach with the state-of-the-art conditional-independence-based algorithm PCMCI+. With extensive numerical experiments we empirically demonstrate that, in addition to providing confidence measures for links, Bagged-PCMCI+ improves in precision and recall as compared to its base algorithm PCMCI+, at the cost of higher computational demands. These statistical performance improvements are especially pronounced in the more challenging settings (short time sample size, large number of variables, high autocorrelation). Our bootstrap approach can also be combined with other time series causal discovery algorithms and can be of considerable use in many real-world applications.},

	abstract = {Time-series datasets are central in numerous fields of science and engineering, such as biomedicine, Earth observation, and network analysis. Extensive research exists on state-space models (SSMs), which are powerful mathematical tools that allow for probabilistic and interpretable learning on time series. Estimating the model parameters in SSMs is arguably one of the most complicated tasks, and the inclusion of prior knowledge is known to both ease the interpretation but also to complicate the inferential tasks. Very recent works have attempted to incorporate a graphical perspective on some of those model parameters, but they present notable limitations that this work addresses. More generally, existing graphical modeling tools are designed to incorporate either static information, focusing on statistical dependencies among independent random variables (e.g., graphical Lasso approach), or dynamic information, emphasizing causal relationships among time series samples (e.g., graphical Granger approaches). However, there are no joint approaches combining static and dynamic graphical modeling within the context of SSMs. This work proposes a novel approach to fill this gap by introducing a joint graphical modeling framework that bridges the static graphical Lasso model and a causal-based graphical approach for the linear-Gaussian SSM. We present DGLASSO (Dynamic Graphical Lasso), a new inference method within this framework that implements an efficient block alternating majorization-minimization algorithm. The algorithm's convergence is established by departing from modern tools from nonlinear analysis. Experimental validation on synthetic and real weather variability data showcases the effectiveness of the proposed model and inference algorithm.},

	abstract = {Causality has the potential to truly transform the way we solve a large number of real-world problems. Yet, so far, its potential largely remains to be unlocked as causality often requires crucial assumptions which cannot be tested in practice. To address this challenge, we propose a new way of thinking about causality -- we call this causal deep learning. Our causal deep learning framework spans three dimensions: (1) a structural dimension, which incorporates partial yet testable causal knowledge rather than assuming either complete or no causal knowledge among the variables of interest; (2) a parametric dimension, which encompasses parametric forms that capture the type of relationships among the variables of interest; and (3) a temporal dimension, which captures exposure times or how the variables of interest interact (possibly causally) over time. Causal deep learning enables us to make progress on a variety of real-world problems by leveraging partial causal knowledge (including independencies among variables) and quantitatively characterising causal relationships among variables of interest (possibly over time). Our framework clearly identifies which assumptions are testable and which ones are not, such that the resulting solutions can be judiciously adopted in practice. Using our formulation we can combine or chain together causal representations to solve specific problems without losing track of which assumptions are required to build these solutions, pushing real-world impact in healthcare, economics and business, environmental sciences and education, through causal deep learning.},

	abstract = {Observational studies require adjustment for confounding factors that are correlated with both the treatment and outcome. In the setting where the observed variables are tabular quantities such as average income in a neighborhood, tools have been developed for addressing such confounding. However, in many parts of the developing world, features about local communities may be scarce. In this context, satellite imagery can play an important role, serving as a proxy for the confounding variables otherwise unobserved. In this paper, we study confounder adjustment in this non-tabular setting, where patterns or objects found in satellite images contribute to the confounder bias. Using the evaluation of anti-poverty aid programs in Africa as our running example, we formalize the challenge of performing causal adjustment with such unstructured data -- what conditions are sufficient to identify causal effects, how to perform estimation, and how to quantify the ways in which certain aspects of the unstructured image object are most predictive of the treatment decision. Via simulation, we also explore the sensitivity of satellite image-based observational inference to image resolution and to misspecification of the image-associated confounder. Finally, we apply these tools in estimating the effect of anti-poverty interventions in African communities from satellite imagery.},

However, the current generation of methods needs to keep pace with the complexity of scientific and stakeholder challenges and data availability combined with the adequacy of data-driven methods. Unless carefully informed by physics, they run the risk of conflating correlation with causation or getting overwhelmed by estimation inaccuracies. Given that natural experiments, controlled trials, interventions, and counterfactual examinations are often impractical, information-theoretic methods have been developed and are being continually refined in the earth sciences. Here we show that transfer entropy-based causal graphs, which have recently become popular in the earth sciences with high-profile discoveries, can be spurious even when augmented with statistical significance. We develop a subsample-based ensemble approach for robust causality analysis. Simulated data, and observations in climate and ecohydrology, suggest the robustness and consistency of this approach.},

	abstract = {Formaldehyde (HCHO) is one one of the most important trace gas in the atmosphere, as it is a pollutant causing respiratory and other diseases. It is also a precursor of tropospheric ozone which damages crops and deteriorates human health. Study of HCHO chemistry and long-term monitoring using satellite data is important from the perspective of human health, food security and air pollution. Dynamic atmospheric chemistry models struggle to simulate atmospheric formaldehyde and often overestimate by up to two times relative to satellite observations and reanalysis. Spatial distribution of modelled HCHO also fail to match satellite observations. Here, we present deep learning approach using a simple super-resolution based convolutional neural network towards simulating fast and reliable atmospheric HCHO. Our approach is an indirect method of HCHO estimation without the need to chemical equations. We find that deep learning outperforms dynamical model simulations which involves complicated atmospheric chemistry representation. Causality establishing the nonlinear relationships of different variables to target formaldehyde is established in our approach by using a variety of precursors from meteorology and chemical reanalysis to target OMI AURA satellite based HCHO predictions. We choose South Asia for testing our implementation as it doesnt have in situ measurements of formaldehyde and there is a need for improved quality data over the region. Moreover, there are spatial and temporal data gaps in the satellite product which can be removed by trustworthy modelling of atmospheric formaldehyde. This study is a novel attempt using computer vision for trustworthy modelling of formaldehyde from remote sensing can lead to cascading societal benefits.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.12532},
	abstract = {This paper introduces causal scoring as a novel approach to frame causal estimation in the context of decision making. Causal scoring entails the estimation of scores that support decision making by providing insights into causal effects. We present three valuable causal interpretations of these scores: effect estimation (EE), effect ordering (EO), and effect classification (EC). In the EE interpretation, the causal score represents the effect itself. The EO interpretation implies that the score can serve as a proxy for the magnitude of the effect, enabling the sorting of individuals based on their causal effects. The EC interpretation enables the classification of individuals into high- and low-effect categories using a predefined threshold. We demonstrate the value of these alternative causal interpretations (EO and EC) through two key results. First, we show that aligning the statistical modeling with the desired causal interpretation improves the accuracy of causal estimation. Second, we establish that more flexible causal interpretations are plausible in a wider range of settings and propose conditions to assess their validity. We showcase the practical utility of causal scoring through diverse scenarios, including situations involving unobserved confounding due to self-selection, lack of data on the primary outcome of interest, or lack of data on how individuals behave when intervened. These examples illustrate how causal scoring facilitates reasoning about flexible causal interpretations of statistical estimates in various contexts. They encompass confounded estimates, effect estimates on surrogate outcomes, and even predictions about non-causal quantities as potential causal scores.},

	abstract = {Observational studies of causal effects require adjustment for confounding factors. In the tabular setting, where these factors are well-defined, separate random variables, the effect of confounding is well understood. However, in public policy, ecology, and in medicine, decisions are often made in non-tabular settings, informed by patterns or objects detected in images (e.g., maps, satellite or tomography imagery). Using such imagery for causal inference presents an opportunity because objects in the image may be related to the treatment and outcome of interest. In these cases, we rely on the images to adjust for confounding but observed data do not directly label the existence of the important objects. Motivated by real-world applications, we formalize this challenge, how it can be handled, and what conditions are sufficient to identify and estimate causal effects. We analyze finite-sample performance using simulation experiments, estimating effects using a propensity adjustment algorithm that employs a machine learning model to estimate the image confounding. Our experiments also examine sensitivity to misspecification of the image pattern mechanism. Finally, we use our methodology to estimate the effects of policy interventions on poverty in African communities from satellite imagery.},

Results of the difference-in-differences analysis show that the new terminal significantly increased vehicle traffic in urban Cebu. The effect decays with distance from the airport, is stronger in areas where hotels are located, and is most pronounced in the peak months for international tourists. These findings imply that the opening of the new international terminal has enhanced Cebu's local economy through international tourism.},

	abstract = {Atmospheric correction is a fundamental task in remote sensing because observations are taken either of the atmosphere or looking through the atmosphere. Atmospheric correction errors can significantly alter the spectral signature of the observations, and lead to invalid classifications or target detection. This is even more crucial when working with hyperspectral data, where a precise measurement of spectral properties is required. State-of-the-art physics-based atmospheric correction approaches require extensive prior knowledge about sensor characteristics, collection geometry, and environmental characteristics of the scene being collected. These approaches are computationally expensive, prone to inaccuracy due to lack of sufficient environmental and collection information, and often impossible for real-time applications. In this paper, a geometry-dependent hybrid neural network is proposed for automatic atmospheric correction using multi-scan hyperspectral data collected from different geometries. The proposed network can characterize the atmosphere without any additional meteorological data. A grid-search method is also proposed to solve the temperature emissivity separation problem. Results show that the proposed network has the capacity to accurately characterize the atmosphere and estimate target emissivity spectra with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) under 0.02 for 29 different materials. This solution can lead to accurate atmospheric correction to improve target detection for real time applications.},

We generalize kernel Granger causality by considering the variables cross-relations explicitly in Hilbert spaces, and use the covariance in Gaussian processes. The method generalizes the linear and kernel GC methods, and comes with tighter bounds of performance based on Rademacher complexity.

	title = {Causal inference for climate change events from satellite image time series using computer vision and deep learning},
	abstract = {We propose a method for causal inference using satellite image time series, in order to determine the treatment effects of interventions which impact climate change, such as deforestation. Simply put, the aim is to quantify the ‘before versus after’ effect of climate related human driven interventions, such as urbanization; as well as natural disasters, such as hurricanes and forest fires. As a concrete example, we focus on quantifying forest tree cover change/ deforestation due to human led causes. The proposed method involves the following steps. First, we uae computer vision and machine learning/deep learning techniques to detect and quantify forest tree coverage levels over time, at every time epoch. We then look at this time series to identify changepoints. Next, we estimate the expected (forest tree cover) values using a Bayesian structural causal model and projecting/forecasting the counterfactual. This is compared to the values actually observed post intervention, and the difference in the two values gives us the effect of the intervention (as compared to the non intervention scenario, i.e. what would have possibly happened without the intervention). As a specific use case, we analyze deforestation levels before and after the hyperinflation event (intervention) in Brazil (which ended in 1993-94), for the Amazon rainforest region, around Rondonia, Brazil. For this deforestation use case, using our causal inference framework can help causally attribute change/reduction in forest tree cover and increasing deforestation rates due to human activities at various points in time.},
